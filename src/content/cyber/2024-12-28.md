Programming changes the way you think. It makes you make implicit assumptions explicit. This is a feature of problem solving that interviewers or potential employers are checking for. How many people reside in Gurgaon? How many people reside in Mississauga? Given that the demographics and data sources are so different, what assumptions would you take to reach an answer?

Great programmers are able to make implicit assumptions explicit and use that to solve complex and time consuming problems. Employers are checking to see if the person is [persistant or obstinate](https://paulgraham.com/persistence.html). Knowing when to stop is also a feature of persistant problem solving. If your assumptions are not [sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundness), it’ll be hard to know when to stop.
